# kubeless-ui

Graphical User Interface for Kubeless


## Dev

Project based on [davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)

1. Install dependencies It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well.

```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```

Dev server with Hot Module Replacement should run at http://localhost:3000

## Dev in Docker container

Work in progress... (missing hmr)

```bash
docker-compose up
```
